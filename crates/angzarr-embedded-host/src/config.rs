//! The host's config: its schema, `angzarr.yaml`, is
//! angzarr-embedded-host-config's, re-exported here ([`HostConfig`] and its
//! children, the versioned [`loader`] and its [`FIXTURES`]), and read
//! strictly ([`parse`]): a config that does not load is refused as
//! [`HostError::ConfigInvalid`], its cause the reader's error naming the
//! key path where it goes wrong. What the schema cannot know is here: the
//! languages the running application loads.
//!
//! `language` is a closed set, populated by the languages loaded
//! ([`Languages`]): the built-in Rust (in process) and Python (a child,
//! `uv run --locked`), and any the application loads before it starts
//! ([`crate::run_with_languages`]); one not loaded is refused with its key
//! path and the languages loaded ([`HostError::UnknownLanguage`]). A loaded
//! language with no default launch command needs each component's
//! `launch`.
//!
//! A component's language picks where it runs and its default launch
//! command, and nothing else: the host speaks one protocol to every child
//! (the handshake, then gRPC on a Unix socket), so a language is loaded
//! with no more than its name ([`Language::child`]) and, if it has one, its
//! default launch ([`Language::launched_by`]).
//!
//! A child's descriptor must agree with its `kind`
//! ([`HostError::KindMismatch`]); a sidecar has none, and is up while its
//! health reports SERVING. An in-process component (Rust, no `launch`) is
//! registered by the application's `register`, and [`run`](crate::run)
//! holds the two to each other: one listed that `register` did not
//! register ([`HostError::NotRegistered`]), and one registered that no
//! `component` entry lists ([`HostError::NotListed`]), are refused, by name
//! and kind; an in-process upcaster's `upcasts` is a domain registered
//! here.
